        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Research Focus</h2>
        <p>We live in an interconnected world where millions of devices generate and store unprecedented amounts of information every day. Properly processing this data, extracting knowledge, and learning from it is vital not only to shed light on the problems our organizations face but also for optimal decision-making in professional, institutional, and scientific environments.</p>
        <p>Contemporary data is highly diverse, contains imperfections, and is often observed incompletely. Equally important, the relationship between the various variables that form the data is not always known, which substantially complicates its analysis and treatment. This necessitates a comprehensive approach that utilizes optimization techniques, signal processing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to process, visualize, and learn from such data.</p>
        <p>This approach cannot be independent of the type of data being analyzed; it must be tailored to the characteristics and particularities of the working databases, which will impact all phases of the project lifecycle.</p>
        
        <h3 style="margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 50px;">Our Team</h3>
        <p>Our group consists of national and international researchers who are experts in the analysis, treatment, and extraction of knowledge from data. Members include experts in mathematical and statistical analysis (optimization, signal processing, machine learning, and neural networks, Bayesian estimation...), data science algorithm developers, programmers, as well as domain experts in areas including cardiac signals, clinical data, multimedia information, meteorological data, acoustic signals, and financial series, to name a few prominent examples.</p>
        
        <h3 style="margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 50px;">Experience</h3>
        <p>We have experience in dozens of competitive national and international projects, having collaborated with more than 10 leading foreign research groups (USA, UK, Netherlands, Sweden...). We also have numerous collaborations with companies through article 83 contracts. In short, we are a multidisciplinary group with leading researchers and technological experts, including both university staff and professionals from the public and private sectors.</p>
